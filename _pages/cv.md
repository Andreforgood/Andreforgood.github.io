Education
======
* B.S. in Mathematical Statistics, Xiamen University, Mainland China 2021.9-2025.6
* Exchange student, Department of Applied Mathematics, National Chiao Tung University 2024.2-2024.6

Intern/Campus/Research experience
======
* Summer 2022: Assistant Data Analyst. 
  * Company: Beijing Analysys Digital Intelligence Technology.
  * Duties includes: Mainly help with data cleaning/ visualization/ predictive modelling. Conducted data analysis on mobile app user interactions to identify content preferences and optimize product recommendations, leading to enhanced sales and customer engagement.
  * Supervisor: Yue Chen

* Winter 2022:  Winter school, Imperial College, topic: data science in health care innovation.
  * Duties includes: Analyzed medical imaging data, specifically lung X-ray images, using Logisitic Regression and SVM models to classify COVID-19 infection.(Binary Classification)
  * Supervisor: Chengliang Dai

* Spring 2023: Research Assistant
  * University of Oxford
  * Duties included: Conducted research utilizing probability theory, Bayesian and regression analysis to understand key principles and develop predictive models. For instance, we implemented a convolutional model to predict TF binding sites from DNA sequences, employing one-hot encoding, embedding techniques (Dimension reduction), stochastic gradient descent, and cross-validation for model optimization and performance evaluation.
  * Supervisor: Dr Jaromir Sant

* Summer 2024: Research Assistant
  * North Carolina State University.
  * Duties included: At NC State, I focused on text processing for the topic AI and Crisis Communication. I extracted key information from research papers, using NLP techniques (LLM) to vectorize text, followed by clustering analysis (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to identify contents like the most common theoretical frameworks and AI models used in the mentioned articles. Additionally, I conducted time series analysis to predict corporate responses (positive, negative or neutral) to public sentiment during crises, utilizing ARIMA, GARCH, and seasonal ARIMA models.
  * Supervisor: Alice Cheng
